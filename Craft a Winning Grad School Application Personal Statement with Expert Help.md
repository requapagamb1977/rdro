## Why You Need a Grad School Personal Statement

Your personal statement is often the deciding factor between getting accepted or being rejected. It’s your opportunity to convey who you are beyond your grades and test scores. Here’s why you shouldn’t take chances:

- **Showcase your experiences:** Admissions committees want to know about your background, research, and why you’re passionate about the program. A great personal statement tells that story effectively.
- **Demonstrate your fit:** You’ll need to clearly explain why you are a good fit for the program and how the program aligns with your career goals.
- **Highlight your strengths:** Emphasize the skills and achievements that will make you an asset to the graduate program.
